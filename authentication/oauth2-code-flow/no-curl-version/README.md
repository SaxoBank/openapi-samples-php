# Sample for authentication using the Code Flow, without cURL

cURL is not available on all installations. This version uses the legacy [file_get_contents()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php). This option is not using HTTP/2 with GZip compression.

> **Warning**
> The [sample using cURL](..) is the fastest and most robuust option!
